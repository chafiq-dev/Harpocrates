This tool honors his name by providing a modern, secure way to embed secret files within ordinary images, ensuring your data remains unseen and protected.Harpocrates is a fully client-side web application that uses modern steganography and cryptography to hide any file inside a standard PNG or JPG image. All processing happens directly in your browser, meaning your files are never uploaded to a server.✨ Features🔒 Strong Encryption: Your secret file is encrypted using AES-256-GCM from the Web Crypto API before being hidden. This provides confidentiality and integrity, making it computationally infeasible for anyone to access the file without the password.🖼️ Any Image, Any File: Hide any file type (documents, videos, archives) inside a standard JPG or PNG image.♾️ No Size Limits: By appending data to the image file, the only limit to the secret file's size is your device's own processing capability.🙈 True Steganography: The encrypted data is appended to the image file, making it appear as a normal image to any standard viewer or editor.📱 Modern & Responsive UI: A sleek, mobile-first interface inspired by Material You, with a beautiful dark mode and interactive elements.🌐 100% Client-Side: Your privacy is paramount. All encoding and decoding operations happen locally in your browser. Nothing is ever sent to a server.🚀 How It WorksThe process is simple yet robust:Encode (Hide a File):Select a carrier image (JPG or PNG).Select the secret file you want to hide.Set a strong password.Harpocrates encrypts your secret file and its name, then invisibly appends this encrypted data to the end of the carrier image.You can then download the new image, which looks and functions just like the original.Decode (Reveal a File):Upload the image created by Harpocrates.Enter the correct password.The application finds the hidden data, decrypts it, and allows you to download the original secret file.🛠️ Technical DetailsCryptography: Web Crypto API (AES-256-GCM) for authenticated encryption.Key Derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a random 16-byte salt to derive a strong encryption key from your password.Steganography Method: The encrypted payload is appended to the image file, preceded by a unique "magic delimiter" that allows Harpocrates to locate the hidden data during the decoding process.❤️ Support MeIf you find Harpocrates useful, please consider supporting its development.
